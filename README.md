# Web Gallery: Deployment

The objective of these assignments is to build an application called _The Web Gallery_ where users can share pictures and comments. This application is similar to existing web applications such as Facebook, Instagram or Google Photos.

In this last assignment, you will concentrate on user authentication, and authorization.

## Instructions

Copy your assignment 3 code into this repository. You will also need to fix all issues that were found in previous assignments.

### Submission

You should submit your work to your Github course repository and Gradescope.

You must include a url.txt which contains the URL of your deployed application. The URL should be accessible to the TAs and markers.

## Deployment Requirements

- Your assignment 3 must be deployed on a DigitalOcean droplet. (This is provided by the University.)
- Your deployed URL must be a subdomain of `webgallery.<any domain you own>`. You may get a free domain through Github Student Developer Pack or use a domain you already own.
- The deployed application must be accessible via HTTPS.
- The deployed application must be running on port 443.
- The assignment must be feature complete.

## Syllabus

This is a bonus assignment to allow you to make up for any lost points in previous assignments.

You will be graded from a scale of 0-5 points:

- 0 points: No deployment or deployment does not meet the requirements.
- 1 point: Deployment meets the requirements but the application is not feature complete.
- 2 points: Deployment meets the requirements and the application has many code quality issues, and/or many bugs.
- 3 points: Deployment meets the requirements and the application has some code quality issues, and/or a few bugs.
- 4 points: Deployment meets the requirements and the application has minor code quality issues, and/or minor bugs.
- 5 points: This is a perfect assignment!

Suitable bonus points will be added to the final grade to the course. You may not exceed 30% through the assignment.
